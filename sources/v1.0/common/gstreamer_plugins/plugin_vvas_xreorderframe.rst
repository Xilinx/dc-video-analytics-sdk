vvas_xreorderframe
==================

The ``vvas_xreorderframe`` plug-in is utilized in video analytics pipelines to perform inference in conjunction with :ref:`vvas_xskipframe` plug-in, which regulates the inference rate. This plug-in comprises two sink pads and one source pad. One of the sink pads is linked with the :ref:`vvas_xskipframe` plug-in, while the other sink pad is connected to the :ref:`vvas_xinfer` plug-in. It has the ability to receive frames in arbitrary order from both ``vvas_xinfer`` and ``vvas_xskipframe`` plug-ins, and it rearranges them into the correct order of presentation before sending them downstream. Additionally, ``vvas_xreorderframe`` is capable of handling frames/images from multiple sources, and it employs the ``GstVvasSrcIDMeta`` metadata attached to GstBuffer to obtain the stream ID and frame ID and arrange the frames of various sources in the appropriate order.

Refer the example pipeline in :ref:`vvas_xtracker` plugin for the usage of :ref:`vvas_xreorderframe` plugin along with :ref:`vvas_xskipframe` plugin to achieve tracker usecase. 

Input and Output
--------------------

vvas_xreorderframe plugin is format agnostic and can accept any format on input and output pads.
