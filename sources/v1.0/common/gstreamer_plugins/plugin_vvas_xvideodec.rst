vvas_xvideodec
***************

The Versal family of devices includes an IP called ``VDU`` which is designed for hardware accelerated video decoding. This IP is capable of decoding video formats such as H264, H265. Please refer to `VDU PG414 <https://www.xilinx.com/content/dam/xilinx/support/documents/ip_documentation/vdu/v1_0/pg414-vdu.pdf>`_ for more information on the AMD/Xilinx VDU block.

``vvas_xvideodec`` plugin controls the ``VDU`` IP for Video Decoding jobs. This plug-in is used only in PCIe/DC platform. For implementation details, refer to `vvas_xvideodec source code <https://github.com/Xilinx/VVAS/tree/master/vvas-gst-plugins/sys/videodec>`_

Input and Output
================

This plug-in supports H264 and H265 encoded streams of various profile, level values as input. For complete list of supported profiles and levels, please refer to `VDU PG414 <https://www.xilinx.com/content/dam/xilinx/support/documents/ip_documentation/vdu/v1_0/pg414-vdu.pdf>`_
The native output of this plugin is NV12 format. For any other desired output format, it should be software-converted and will affect performance.

Control Parameters and Plug-in Properties

Example Pipelines
-----------------

The following pipeline takes MP4 file with H264 codec as an input and provides raw decoded output in NV12 format. Please refer above table for other parameters and values.

`dev-idx` represents the zero based index of the device on which this decoder to be launched. Please note that 'dev-idx' parameter range can vary from 0 to N-1 where N can be obtained with below command:

.. code-block:: shell

    N=xbutil  examine | grep xilinx_v70 | wc -l

.. code-block:: shell

        gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=<input compressed H264 stream in MP4 container> \
        ! qtdemux ! h264parse \
        ! vvas_xvideodec kernel-name=kernel_vdu_decoder:{kernel_vdu_decoder_0} dev-idx=0 instance-id=0 avoid-output-copy=false xclbin-location=<xclbin file path> \
        ! fpsdisplaysink name=fpssink video-sink=fakesink text-overlay=false sync=false

**kernel-name** is mandatory and represents both the name of the decoder kernel as well as its instance. In above example, "kernel-name=kernel_vdu_decoder:{kernel_vdu_decoder_0}" represents decoder kernel name as "kernel_vdu_decoder" and instance "0". Instance Id range can be known from the below command:

.. code-block:: shell

       xbutil examine -d <PCI bdf>

Currently, 2 instances of video decoder IP (VDU) are supported and can be selected with the plugin parameter **instance-id**. Above example uses instance id = 0.
