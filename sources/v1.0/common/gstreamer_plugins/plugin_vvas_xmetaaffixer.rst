vvas_xmetaaffixer
==================

The ``vvas_xmetaaffixer`` plug-in is designed to adjust the metadata information for different resolutions. When performing machine learning on a frame with a different resolution or color format from the original, the metadata may still be associated with the original, full-resolution frame. The vvas_metaaffixer includes two types of pads: master pads and slave pads. The number of input pads created depends on the number of input sources and can be requested as needed. The plug-in requires at least one mandatory master input pad (sink pad) to receive the original/reference metadata, while the remaining input pads are referred to as slave pads. The metadata received on the master sink pad is adjusted based on the resolution of each slave sink pad. The adjusted metadata is then added to the output buffer coming out of the source slave pads. Up to 16 slave pads can be created as required. For implementation details, refer to `vvas_xmetaaffixer source code <https://github.com/Xilinx/VVAS/tree/master/vvas-gst-plugins/gst/metaaffixer>`_

Input and Output
--------------------

This plug-in is format agnostic and can accept any input format. It operates only on the metadata. The ``vvas_xmetaaffixer`` plug-in supports the ``GstInferenceMeta`` data structure. For details about this structure, refer to the :doc:`VVAS Inference Metadata <../meta_data/vvas_meta_data_structures>` section.

Pad naming syntax
---------------------------

The pad naming syntax is listed, and the following image shows the syntax:

* MetaAffixer master input pad should be named sink_master.

* MetaAffixer master output pad should be named src_master.

* MetaAffixer slave input pad should be named sink_slave_0, sink_slave_1.

* MetaAffixer slave output pad should be named src_slave_0, src_slave_1, src_slave_2.
