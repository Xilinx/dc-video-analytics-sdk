.. _vvas_xdefunnel:

vvas_xdefunnel
================

The Gstreamer plug-in, ``vvas_xdefunnel``, is responsible for de-serializing data received from the ``vvas_xfunnel`` plug-in. This plug-in dynamically creates and removes source pads based on events received from the ``vvas_xfunnel`` plug-in.

For ``vvas_xdefunnel`` implementation details, refer to `vvas_xdefunnel source code <https://github.com/Xilinx/VVAS/tree/master/vvas-gst-plugins/gst/defunnel>`_

This plug-in supports:

* Single sink pad, multiple source pads.

* Source pads are sometimes pad.

* Source pads will be added and removed dynamically.

``vvas_xdefunnel`` supports all caps.
