# AMD Video Analytics SDK for Data Center

The AMD Video Analytics SDK for Data Center is a complete software toolkit providing a fast and easy way to develop AI-powered video analytics applications targeting AMD platforms such as the Alveo™ V70 accelerator card. It is an ideal choice for applications such as traffic analysis and pedestrians recognition in smart cities, health and safety monitoring in hospitals, self-checkout, retail analytics, defect detection, and many others.

With the AMD Video Analytics SDK for Data Center, developers can use GStreamer or C APIs to create streaming pipelines integrating neural networks trained in TensorFlow or PyTorch and compiled with the Vitis™ AI development platform.

The AMD Video Analytics SDK provides GStreamer plug-ins and C APIs to very easily interact with optimized hardware accelerators for tasks such as video decoding and encoding, resizing, color space conversion, and AI inferencing.

By performing all the compute-heavy operations of the streaming pipeline in optimized hardware accelerators, the AMD Video Analytics SDK delivers best-in-class performance for video analytics applications.
