vvas_xfunnel
=============

The ``vvas_xfunnel`` VVAS Gstreamer plug-in serializes data on its sink pads by iterating through all of them in a round-robin fashion. If a sink pad has a buffer available, it sends the data on the source pad. If a sink pad does not have data available, the plug-in will wait for a user-configurable amount of time before moving on to the next sink pad.

When a new sink pad is added or removed from the ``vvas_xfunnel`` plug-in, it sends custom events to notify the ``vvas_xdefunnel`` plug-in to create or destroy source pads. Each buffer includes metadata that enables the ``vvas_xdefunnel`` plug-in to determine which source pad the buffer should be sent to.

The vvas_xfunnel plug-in can support a maximum of 256 sink pads connected to it.

``vvas_xfunnel`` supports all caps.

Refer ``vvas_xdefunnel`` plug-in which de-serializes these serialized data and pushes them to the output pads.

For ``vvas_xfunnel`` implementation details, refer to `vvas_xfunnel source code <https://github.com/Xilinx/VVAS/tree/master/vvas-gst-plugins/gst/funnel>`_

This plug-in supports:

* Multiple sink pads, single source pad.

* Sink pads are request pads and they can be added or removed dynamically.

* Serialization of parallel data using round robin algorithm.

.. important:: Caps of all the sink pads must be same, this is to avoid caps renegotiation always when sending buffer from the sink pad which has different caps.
.. important:: There are several custom events sent from this plugin for ``vvas_xdefunnel`` plug-in, intermediate plug-ins must pass these events.
