.. _vvas_xskipframe:

vvas_xskipframe
==================

vvas_xskipframe plugin is used in video analytics pipelines in conjunction with :ref:`vvas_xreorderframe` plugin to control inference rate.
It achieves this by using the user configured infer-interval property and determines which frames to be sent for inference and which frames to be skipped from inference.
For example, if the infer-interval is 1, all frames are sent for inference,
if infer-interval is 2, then every alternate frame is sent for inference.

This element has one sink pad and two source pads. It is multi-stream aware and its sink pad can connect with :ref:`vvas_xfunnel` element to accept frames from multiple streams.
One source pad is connected to :ref:`vvas_xinfer` element to send the frames that are marked for inference, another source pad is connected to :ref:`vvas_xreorderframe` 
to send the frames marked skipped.

:ref:`vvas_xskipframe` plug-in adds frame id to the ``GstVvasSrcIDMeta`` metadata so that :ref:`vvas_xreorderframe` plug-in can identify the order of the frames.

Refer the example pipeline in :ref:`vvas_xtracker` plugin for the usage of :ref:`vvas_xskipframe` plugin along with :ref:`vvas_xreorderframe` plugin to achieve tracker usecase.
